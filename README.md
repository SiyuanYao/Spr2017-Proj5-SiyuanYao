+ Project summary: 
	+ The H-1B is an employment-based, non-immigrant visa category for temporary foreign workers in the United States. For a foreign national to apply for H1-B visa, an US employer must offer a job and petition for H-1B visa with the US immigration department. This is the most common visa status applied for and held by international students once they complete college/higher education (Masters, PhD) and work in the US. The Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) generates program data that is useful information about the immigration programs including the H1-B visa. The raw data could be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7g7UviLDlhuVjhaLWVLZW5WS2c/view?usp=sharing).
	+ In this project, we utilize the H1B visa petition dataset and perform various statistical analysis aiming to find interesting trend. The key components of this app are the following: Interactive Map, Overall H1B Visa Petition Trend, High-Applicant Employers and Job Title, Data Science Related Job Analysis. See our project at [https://proj5.shinyapps.io/h1b-app2/](https://proj5.shinyapps.io/h1b-app2/). You can also regenerate our app by runing [app.R](app/app.R) in the app folder.
